# Financial Time Series Prediction: Optimal Learning Rate and Model Architecture Exploration

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of machine learning techniques for predicting financial market trends, developed as part of an online challenge hosted by [Challenge Data](https://challengedata.ens.fr). It contains a series of analytical notebooks and scripts designed to optimize the performance of predictive models through systematic experimentation and tuning. The datasets used for model training and validation are sourced from the challenge, providing a rich basis for applying and evaluating advanced machine learning strategies in the context of financial data.

## Key Components

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (DataExploration.ipynb)
The repository includes an EDA notebook that guides the initial investigation of the financial time series data. This notebook covers data visualization, statistical summaries, and preliminary analysis, laying the groundwork for informed model development and hypothesis generation.


### Optimal Learning Rate Determination
A Python notebook implementing a Learning Rate Finder to empirically identify the most effective learning rate for training deep learning models. This facilitates the selection of a learning rate that balances the convergence speed and stability of the model training process.

### Model Architecture Optimization with KerasTuner
Utilizes KerasTuner to automate the search for the optimal neural network architecture. Evaluates various configurations to identify the structure offering the best prediction accuracy for financial time series data.

### Predictive Modeling with XGBoost
Demonstrates the application of the XGBoost framework to financial time series prediction, emphasizing model setup, tuning, and evaluation, and showcasing XGBoost's capabilities in handling financial data complexities.

### LSTM-Based Time Series Forecasting
Explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting market conditions, including steps for data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation, highlighting LSTMs' strengths in capturing temporal dependencies.
